Protect your private catalog and private products
:   Add an extra layer of protection to your private catalogs with context-based restrictions. Users can view the catalogs that you protect only if they satisfy your rule. For more information, see [Protecting catalogs with context-based restrictions](/docs/account?topic=account-cbr&interface=terraform).


### 09 November 2023
{: #overview-nov0923}
{: release-note}

Onboarding virtual server images with Terraform is deprecated
:   As of 9 November 2023, the option to onboard virtual server images with Terraform is deprecated. If you onboarded software by using this delivery method before this date, your customers can still install the VSIs, but you can't provide any version updates. After 29 March 2024, onboarding virtual server images with Terraform is no longer supported as a delivery method, which means that no new virtual server images with Terraform can be onboarded. Existing VSIs in the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} catalog will be available to use, but to take advantage of version updates and ensure continued support, onboard virtual server images for Virtual Private Cloud directly. For more information, see [Onboarding a virtual server image for VPC](/docs/account?topic=account-catalog-vsivpc-tutorial).

### 06 November 2023
{: #overview-nov0623}

An extra layer of security for users that don't use MFA
:   {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} recommends enabling multifactor authentication (MFA) for all users in your account, but some automation scenarios might require you to exclude specific users from your MFA requirement. For users that are excluded from MFA, you can make access more secure by disabling CLI logins with only a username and password. This way, you require an API key to log in to the CLI or users can log in with `--sso`. For more information, see [Disabling MFA](/docs/account?topic=account-enablemfa#disablemfa).

{: release-note}

Time-based conditions in IAM access policies
:   {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} IAM is excited to give customers the ability to set access controls based on a specified time and date. You can now create policies that grant employees access to a resource during only their working hours, or grant automated processes temporary access for a specified duration. Implementing such limitations helps you to apply the principle of least privilege for assigning access and reduces the opportunity for attack in the event of a security breach. For more information, see [Limiting access with time-based conditions](/docs/account?topic=account-iam-time-based&interface=ui).

IAM Policy Management API V2 release
:   A new version (`v2`) of the IAM Policy Management API is now available. This version adds a new JSON schema to support a conditional policy construct and several time-based comparison operators. These operators provide the capability to restrict access based on time and date. With time-based access control, customers can establish granular policy enforcement based on a specified time period.

Securing your resources with context-based restrictions
:   You can now use context-based restrictions to configure and enforce access restrictions for {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} resources. The access restrictions are based on the network location where an access request is created. These restrictions work in tandem with traditional IAM access policies, which are based on identity, to provide an extra layer of protection. Since both IAM access and context-based restrictions must enforce access, context-based restrictions offer protection even in the face of compromised or mismanaged credentials.

   You can create context-based restrictions by defining one or more network zones, which contain allowed network locations, and then associating the zones with the cloud resource through a context-based restrictions rule. Network zones can be defined in terms of IP address constructs, VPCs, and service references, which grant access to a resource from another cloud service.

Support for U2F MFA and other MFA factors
:   By default, users in your account authenticate themselves by logging in with a username and password. To require users to use more secure authentication factors, the following MFA options are now available.
   * MFA for users with an IBMid: Users authenticate by using an IBMid, password, and time-based one-time passcode (TOTP). This option applies to all users or just non-federated users.
   * MFA for all users: This option applies to users who are using either an IBMid or an external identity provider (IdP). Users authenticate by using email-based MFA, TOTP MFA, or U2F MFA. The U2F MFA factor is based on the FIDO U2F standard, and it offers the highest level of security.

{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} enterprises for centrally managing multiple accounts
:   You can now centrally manage billing and usage for multiple accounts by creating an {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} enterprise. With an enterprise, you can create a multitiered hierarchy of accounts by organizing related accounts into account groups. Enterprises simplify management of multiple accounts with the following key features:
   * Consolidated billing means that you can manage billing, invoicing, and payment for all accounts from a single place, the enterprise account.
   * Subscription credit is aggregated into a credit pool and shared with all accounts in the enterprise. Not only is tracking your subscriptions easier, but you can get fewer, larger subscriptions for a better discount because the credit is shared.
   * Top-down usage reporting gives you a unified view of usage costs from all accounts, organized according to your enterprise hierarchy.

   If you have multiple accounts, at least one of which is a Subscription account, you can create an enterprise. See [What is an enterprise?](/docs/secure-enterprise?topic=secure-enterprise-what-is-enterprise) and [Introducing IBM Cloud Enterprises](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/blog/announcements/introducing-ibm-cloud-enterprises){: external}  for more information.

:   If you have a Subscription account, you can now view all of your subscriptions and analyze your credit spending on the Subscriptions page. You get a high-level view of the total subscription credit in your account and detailed charts that visualize trends such as your credit burndown and monthly spending. You can also view credit from any promotions in your account. For more information, see [Managing subscriptions](/docs/billing-usage?topic=billing-usage-subscriptions).

   Additionally, to better reflect their usage, codes that you apply to add subscription credit to your account are now called subscription codes rather than feature codes.

New Cloud Foundry API endpoints
:   The legacy `api.*.bluemix.net` Cloud Foundry API endpoints are still available for compatibility with earlier versions. However, you can update scripts and infrastructure automation to use the following new Cloud Foundry API endpoints for your region:
   * api.us-south.cf.cloud.ibm.com (previously api.ng.bluemix.net)
   * api.eu-gb.cf.cloud.ibm.com (previously api.eu-gb.bluemix.net)
   * api.us-east.cf.cloud.ibm.com (previously api.us-east.bluemix.net)
   * api.eu-de.cf.cloud.ibm.com (previously api.eu-de.bluemix.net)
   * api.au-syd.cf.cloud.ibm.com (previously api.au-syd.bluemix.net)

Enhanced support experience for {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}
:   With the Support Center, you can work to resolve all {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}-related issues. The landing page provides you FAQs, so you can find the answer to your question without even contacting {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}. You can also chat with a live support rep. Your cases can now be managed in from a single location. In the console, go to **Support** &gt; **Manage cases** to create, view, or edit cases.

   You can also find the [Status page](https://cloud.ibm.com/status){: external} from the Support Center. It is enhanced to include all unplanned incidents, planned maintenance, announcements, and security bulletin notifications about key events that affect the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} platform, infrastructure, and major services. Click **View cloud status** from the Support Center. To check out the new experience, log in and go to the [Support Center](https://cloud.ibm.com/unifiedsupport/supportcenter){: external} .

Unified login, API keys, and user and access management
:   With our latest updates, you can take advantage of a simplified secure login that is available for all users regardless of your ID type. Whether you have an IBMid or a SoftLayer ID, you can quickly log in to the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} console from our enhanced login page. You can also make secure API calls across {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} and automate your CLI login by using an IAM API key or an IAM access token.

   After you log in, you can now see all users, including platform and classic infrastructure users, from your Users page in the Access (IAM) UI. Depending on your access to view other users in the account, you can filter your view quickly by account users, classic infrastructure users, or Cloud Foundry org. You can also use the filters to find users quickly by name, email, or status.

   Now that all of your users are in a single console, you can manage their access to all types of resources from the same place. Access starts with the user, so start by selecting a user from your list. Then, depending on which type of resource that you want to assign access to, you can choose from IAM access policies, Cloud Foundry access, or classic infrastructure permissions. If you want to assign IAM access policies, try creating an access group to streamline your access management process by adding all users to the same access group that need the same policies assigned.

   For more details, check out [Outstanding User Access Improvements Help Deliver a Unified {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Platform](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/blog/announcements/ibm-cloud-access-management){: external}.

New dashboard and Resource list page
:   With our latest update, you can now view all your platform and infrastructure services from one location. When you log in, you can check out the new dashboard. After you add resources to your account from the catalog, you can use your resource list to get a full view of your account resources:
   * The dashboard is redesigned so that you can view a summary your resources, maintenance, status, apps, support, usage, and users.
   * You can find more details about your resources by going to your resource list. You can tag your resources to organize them, or select them to update the details page.
   * Now that you can see all of your resources in one place, we added a global search so that you can quickly find resources that you created and expect to find in your resource list.
   * You can also search for catalog results, so you can quickly find resources to add to your account.

Organize your resources with tags
:   Tags are now available for you to add to your resources, like Cloud Object Storage, to help you manage resources and find the resources that are the most relevant to you. For example, if you have hundreds of resources and you want to differentiate between ones that are paid the same way, you could tag them with `costcenter:location01`. Or, if you have a team that is working on a couple of resources repeatedly, you can use something like `team-blue`. You can also filter the My resources page by tags to quickly organize and find the resources that you need. For more information, see [Working with tags](/docs/account?topic=account-tag) and [Platform Tagging on the Enhanced {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Platform](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/blog/announcements/platform-tagging-on-the-enhanced-ibm-cloud-platform){: external}.

Get accurate monthly costs with the cost estimator
:   To help you decide and analyze what services you'd like to purchase, you can use the cost estimator. Now, you can go through the console and select each service you'd like to have, and add all of the costs in an easy to use tool. You can even enter projected data usages, lookups per second, writes per second, and queries per second to get a more accurate estimation of your monthly expenditures. You can use the cost estimator with each catalog service you select, or you can click the Cost Estimator icon ![Cost Estimator icon](../icons/calculator.svg "Cost Estimator") in the console menu to get a summary of your estimated costs.

Updated global location names
:   As {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} continues to expand our global availability footprint, we’re updating our location naming structure to better support an understandable, consistent hierarchy of geographies, regions, and data centers around the world. If you’re familiar with our current global regions, you’ll recognize names like US South and Sydney. We’re aligning these location names to the names of the city in which the data centers physically exist.

   For now, the programmatic IDs are not changing, so there’s no impact from an API perspective. The following table shows the old and new location names. For more information and a comprehensive list of data centers and regions, see [Service availability](/docs/overview?topic=overview-services_region).

Assign account management access to others
:   With {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Identity and Access Management (IAM), you can delegate common tasks that you complete as an account administrator to another user in your account. By creating an access policy on one or all of the available account management services, you can easily delegate responsibilities such as inviting and removing users, managing access groups, managing service IDs, maintaining private catalog services, and even monitoring billing and tracking usage. There are four individual account management services and an all services option that you can use to set up access policies:
   * User Management for inviting and removing users
   * IAM Access Groups for creating, editing, deleting, updating, and assigning access
   * IAM Identity Service for viewing, creating, deleting, and assigning access to service IDs and associated API keys across the account
   * Global resource catalog for viewing private catalog offerings and updating the metadata and visibility for the offerings
   * All account management services for access to each of the individual account management service options based on the assigned role as well as access to billing and usage tracking.

   For more information on the tasks that a user can do based on which account management service they have a policy on and which role they are assigned, see [Example platform management roles and actions for account management services](/docs/account?topic=account-account-services#account-management-actions-roles).

A new way to organize resources within your account
:   Resource groups are a new way for you to create customizable groupings of account resources, and access to the group and the resources within it are managed by using Identity and Access Management (IAM). Everyone starts out with a default resource group. You can rename this resource group and add new service instances to it as you create them from the catalog.

   For users with a Pay-As-You-Go or Subscription account, you can create extra resource groups to make managing quota and viewing billing usage for a set of resources easier. You can also group resources to make it easier for you to assign users access to more than one service at a time. To learn more about working with resource groups for your account, see [Managing resource groups](/docs/account?topic=account-rgs).

Updates for {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} IAM
:   The introduction of resource groups within your {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} account provides a new way for you to assign access. Users and service IDs can be assigned access to all services within a resource group, enabling you to quickly assign access to more than one resource at a time. You can also customize access for each user or service ID by assigning access to just some services within a resource group, or you choose to assign access to individual resources down to the service instance level. For more information about the features that you can take advantage of by using IAM, see [What features does IAM provide?](/docs/account?topic=account-iamoverview#features)

Customize your dashboard view
:   You can view and manage all the resources in your account from your dashboard in the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} console. And now, you can set filters to customize your view. For example, you can filter by resource group to view the specific resources in a resource group. You can also filter by region or Cloud Foundry space.
